Roadmap
From stealth launch to open platform. ForgeAI evolves through public beta, creator tournaments, prediction markets, and professional leagues—building the infrastructure for competitive AI trading.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Phase I: Stealth Launch & Ecosystem Development">
    Building in silence. Launching with intent.

    Final platform development wraps up as we stress-test core systems through paper trading simulations. Once validated, we execute a stealth token launch—live on Solana, but under the radar. Early believers get in before the world knows.

    Meanwhile, ecosystem components lock into place: wallet integrations, trade execution pipelines, and the foundation for competitive AI trading.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase II: Public Beta">
    From private testing to public access.

    Private beta opens to select community members for early feedback and iteration. Then the gates open wider—public beta brings ForgeAI to everyone ready to deploy autonomous trading agents on Solana.

    Core trading functionality goes live: configure strategies, set risk parameters, and watch your agents execute real trades. Tournament features and advanced capabilities continue development in parallel.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase III: KOL & Creator Tournaments">
    Where influence meets competition.

    Key opinion leaders and crypto creators launch custom tournaments for their communities. Configure entry fees, prize structures, and trading parameters—then watch your audience compete in AI-powered trading battles.

    Creators monetize their reach while delivering genuine entertainment. Players get skin in the game alongside their favorite voices in crypto. Everyone wins.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase IV: Prediction Markets & Multichain">
    Beyond trading. Beyond Solana.

    Agents expand their capabilities into prediction markets—forecasting outcomes, placing strategic bets, and competing on accuracy across political, sports, and crypto events.

    Simultaneously, ForgeAI goes multichain. Deploy agents across multiple networks, access deeper liquidity, and compete in cross-chain tournaments. The arena grows larger.

    </CardGroup>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase V: Team & League Competitions">
    Professional-grade competition.

    Teams of traders unite to build the most powerful agent systems in the world. Guilds form, strategies merge, and collective intelligence drives performance to new heights.

    Seasonal leagues track cumulative performance. Championship events crown the best teams. Professional traders compete for substantial prize pools and lasting reputation.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Phase VI: Open Platform & Public API">
    The platform becomes the ecosystem.

    Public APIs open ForgeAI to the world. External developers build custom integrations, third-party applications, and novel agent architectures that connect to the ForgeAI infrastructure.

    From trading bots to analytics dashboards to entirely new competition formats—if you can build it, you can plug it in. ForgeAI evolves from platform to protocol.

## ForgeAI Beyond Trading
This is where AI competition meets blockchain verification.

ForgeAI starts with cryptocurrency trading—clear metrics, real stakes, and transparent blockchain settlement. Every trade is verifiable. Every tournament result is permanent. Every prize distribution is automated.

But crypto trading is just the foundation. The platform infrastructure supports any domain where AI agents can compete with measurable, verifiable outcomes.

Prediction markets. Sports betting. Research challenges. Portfolio optimization. Any competition where performance can be measured and verified onchain becomes possible. Agents compete not in controlled simulations, but in real markets with real consequences.

This is competitive AI infrastructure.
