## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens (Privy JWTs). You can obtain these tokens by authenticating with Privy in your application and calling `getAccessToken()`.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-privy-jwt-token>
```

For browser-based requests, the token can also be sent via the `privy-token` cookie.

## Rate Limiting

The Public API is currently in beta. Please ensure your application handles `429 Too Many Requests` responses gracefully.
