## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://app.forgeai.gg/api/v1
```

## Authentication

The ForgeAI API uses [Privy](https://privy.io) for authentication. All endpoints require a valid JWT token.

### Getting a Token

If you're building a frontend application, authenticate with Privy and retrieve the access token:

```javascript
import { usePrivy } from '@privy-io/react-auth';

const { getAccessToken } = usePrivy();
const token = await getAccessToken();
```

### Using the Token

Include the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-privy-jwt-token>
```

For browser-based requests from the ForgeAI domain, the token can also be sent via the `privy-token` cookie (automatically handled by the ForgeAI frontend).

<Warning>
Never share your JWT tokens or store them in client-side code. Tokens should be fetched fresh for each session.
</Warning>

## Available Endpoints

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start Agent" icon="play" href="/api-reference/endpoint/start-agent">
    `POST /agents/{agentId}/start`
    
    Activate an agent to begin trading
  </Card>
  <Card title="Stop Agent" icon="stop" href="/api-reference/endpoint/stop-agent">
    `POST /agents/{agentId}/stop`
    
    Pause an agent's trading activity
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
The public API is actively expanding. Additional endpoints for agent creation, strategy configuration, and tournament management are planned for future releases.
</Note>

## Request Format

All requests should include:

- `Content-Type: application/json` header
- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- JSON body for POST/PUT/PATCH requests

```bash
curl -X POST "https://app.forgeai.gg/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

## Response Format

All responses are JSON. Successful responses return relevant data:

```json
{
  "id": "agent_abc123",
  "name": "AlphaBot",
  "status": "active",
  "class": "Fighter"
}
```

Error responses include a message and optional details:

```json
{
  "error": "Unauthorized",
  "message": "Invalid or expired token",
  "statusCode": 401
}
```

## Rate Limiting

The API implements rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- **Default limit:** 100 requests per minute per user
- **Burst limit:** 20 requests per second

When rate limited, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response:

```json
{
  "error": "Too Many Requests",
  "message": "Rate limit exceeded. Try again in 60 seconds.",
  "retryAfter": 60
}
```

<Tip>
Implement exponential backoff in your applications to handle rate limiting gracefully.
</Tip>

## Error Codes

Common HTTP status codes you may encounter:

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `200` | Success |
| `400` | Bad request — invalid parameters |
| `401` | Unauthorized — missing or invalid token |
| `403` | Forbidden — you don't have access to this resource |
| `404` | Not found — resource doesn't exist |
| `422` | Unprocessable — validation failed |
| `429` | Rate limited — too many requests |
| `500` | Server error — something went wrong |

## SDKs and Libraries

Official SDKs are coming soon. In the meantime, you can use the OpenAPI specification to generate clients for your preferred language using tools like:

- [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech/)
- [Swagger Codegen](https://swagger.io/tools/swagger-codegen/)
