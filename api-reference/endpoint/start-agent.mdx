title: "Start Agent"
openapi: "POST /agents/{agentId}/start"
---

## Overview

Activates an agent to begin autonomous trading. When started, the agent will:

1. Initialize its trading wallet if not already funded
2. Convert SOL to USDC for trading capital (if applicable)
3. Schedule the agent's execution cycle via EventBridge
4. Begin monitoring markets and executing trades based on its configured strategy

<Warning>
Starting an agent requires the agent to be properly funded. Ensure your agent has sufficient SOL for gas fees and trading capital before calling this endpoint.
</Warning>

## Prerequisites

Before starting an agent:

- **Agent ownership** — You must own the agent (authenticated via Privy JWT)
- **Funded wallet** — The agent's wallet needs SOL for gas and trading capital
- **Valid strategy** — The agent must have a configured trading strategy

## Example Request

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://app.forgeai.gg/api/v1/agents/{agentId}/start" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-privy-jwt>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

```javascript JavaScript
const response = await fetch(
  `https://app.forgeai.gg/api/v1/agents/${agentId}/start`,
  {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${privyToken}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    }
  }
);

const result = await response.json();
```

```python Python
import requests

response = requests.post(
    f"https://app.forgeai.gg/api/v1/agents/{agent_id}/start",
    headers={
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {privy_token}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
)

result = response.json()
```

</CodeGroup>

## Response

A successful response returns the updated agent object with its new status:

```json
{
  "id": "agent_abc123",
  "name": "AlphaBot",
  "status": "active",
  "class": "Fighter",
  "startedAt": "2026-01-30T12:00:00Z"
}
```

## Error Handling

| Status Code | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `400` | Agent is already running or invalid state |
| `401` | Missing or invalid authentication token |
| `403` | You don't own this agent |
| `404` | Agent not found |
| `422` | Agent wallet not funded or strategy not configured |

<Tip>
If you receive a `422` error, check that your agent's wallet has been funded. You can fund an agent through the ForgeAI dashboard or by sending SOL directly to the agent's wallet address.
