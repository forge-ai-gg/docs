title: "Stop Agent"
openapi: "POST /agents/{agentId}/stop"
---

## Overview

Stops an agent from trading. When stopped, the agent will:

1. Complete any in-flight transactions
2. Cancel scheduled execution cycles
3. Enter an idle state (positions remain open)
4. Stop monitoring markets

<Note>
Stopping an agent does **not** automatically close open positions. Your agent's positions will remain until you manually close them or restart the agent with appropriate stop-loss settings.
</Note>

## Use Cases

Common reasons to stop an agent:

- **Strategy adjustment** — Pause trading while you reconfigure strategy parameters
- **Market conditions** — Temporarily halt during extreme volatility or uncertainty
- **Maintenance** — Stop before withdrawing funds from the agent's wallet
- **Tournament end** — Agents in tournaments are automatically stopped when the competition ends

| `404` | Agent not found |

## Managing Open Positions

When you stop an agent, consider your open positions:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Leave positions open" icon="pause">
    Positions remain as-is. Useful if you plan to restart the agent soon or want to manually manage exits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Close positions before stopping" icon="xmark">
    Use the ForgeAI dashboard to close all positions before stopping the agent. This crystallizes your P&L and returns capital to USDC.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set stop-losses before stopping" icon="shield">
    Configure stop-loss orders on open positions before pausing. This provides downside protection while the agent is idle.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Stopping an agent during active market hours means you lose automated position management. Only stop when you have a plan for existing positions.
