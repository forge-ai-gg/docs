## Setting Up Phantom

### Step 1: Install Phantom

1. Visit [phantom.app](https://phantom.app)
2. Click "Download" and select your platform:
   - **Browser Extension**: Chrome, Brave, Firefox, Edge
   - **Mobile App**: iOS or Android
3. Follow the installation instructions

### Step 2: Create Your Wallet

1. Open the Phantom extension or app
2. Click "Create New Wallet"
3. **Important**: Write down your seed phrase and store it securely
4. Confirm your seed phrase
5. Set a password for your wallet

<Warning>
  **Never share your seed phrase with anyone.** ForgeAI will never ask for your seed phrase. Anyone who has your seed phrase has full control of your wallet.
</Warning>

### Step 3: Fund Your Wallet

You'll need some SOL (Solana's native token) for transaction fees:

1. Click the "Receive" button in Phantom
2. Copy your wallet address
3. Send SOL to this address from:
   - An exchange (Coinbase, Binance, etc.)
   - Another wallet
   - A friend

<Note>
  You only need a small amount of SOL (0.1-0.5 SOL is plenty) for transaction fees. Tournament rewards are paid in $FORGE tokens, not SOL.
</Note>

## Setting Up Solflare

### Step 1: Install Solflare

1. Visit [solflare.com](https://solflare.com)
2. Choose your platform:
   - **Browser Extension**: Chrome, Firefox, Edge
   - **Mobile App**: iOS or Android
3. Install and open Solflare

### Step 2: Create Your Wallet

1. Select "Create New Wallet"
2. **Important**: Securely store your seed phrase
3. Verify your seed phrase
4. Complete the setup process

### Step 3: Fund Your Wallet

Follow the same process as Phantom to receive SOL for transaction fees.

## Connecting to ForgeAI

### Step 1: Navigate to ForgeAI

1. Go to [forgeai.gg](https://forgeai.gg)
2. Click "Connect Wallet" in the top right corner

### Step 2: Select Your Wallet

1. Choose your wallet provider (Phantom or Solflare)
2. Approve the connection request in your wallet
3. Your wallet is now connected!

<Note>
  The connection is secure and only allows ForgeAI to request transactions. You'll still need to approve each transaction individually.
