## Wallet Issues

### Wallet Won't Connect

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Connection times out or fails" icon="plug">
    **Try these steps:**
    1. Refresh the page and try connecting again
    2. Check that your wallet extension is unlocked
    3. Ensure you're on the Solana mainnet network
    4. Try disconnecting and reconnecting your wallet
    5. Clear your browser cache and cookies
    6. Try a different browser (Chrome/Brave recommended)
    
    **Still not working?** Some wallet extensions conflict with each other. Try disabling other wallet extensions temporarily.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong network selected" icon="network-wired">
    ForgeAI operates on **Solana mainnet**. If your wallet is set to devnet or testnet:
    1. Open your wallet settings
    2. Look for "Network" or "Cluster" settings
    3. Select "Mainnet" or "Mainnet Beta"
    4. Refresh ForgeAI and reconnect
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transaction approval not appearing" icon="eye-slash">
    If the wallet approval popup doesn't appear:
    1. Check if the popup is blocked—look for a blocked popup icon in your browser's address bar
    2. Make sure your wallet extension is pinned and visible
    3. Try clicking the wallet extension icon directly
    4. Some wallets open approvals in a separate tab—check your open tabs
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Insufficient Balance Errors

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Not enough SOL for gas" icon="gas-pump">
    Every transaction on Solana requires a small amount of SOL for gas fees (typically 0.000005-0.001 SOL).
    
    **Solution:** Ensure you have at least **0.01 SOL** in your wallet for gas fees.
    
    <Tip>Keep a small buffer of SOL in your wallet at all times for transaction fees.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not enough funds for tournament entry" icon="coins">
    Tournament entries require the exact entry fee amount plus gas.
    
    **Check:**
    - Entry fee currency (SOL or USDC)
    - Your balance matches or exceeds the entry fee
    - You have additional SOL for gas fees
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agent Issues

### Agent Not Trading

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent status shows 'Idle'" icon="pause">
    Agents may be idle for several reasons:
    
    1. **No trading opportunities** — Your agent's strategy criteria aren't being met in current market conditions. This is normal behavior.
    2. **Agent paused** — Check if you manually paused the agent.
    3. **Insufficient funds** — The agent's wallet needs enough funds to execute trades.
    4. **Tournament not started** — If in a tournament, trading only occurs during the active competition phase.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent stuck in 'Starting' state" icon="spinner">
    If your agent has been "Starting" for more than 5 minutes:
    
    1. Refresh the page
    2. Try stopping and restarting the agent
    3. Check your internet connection
    4. If the issue persists, the agent infrastructure may be experiencing high load—wait a few minutes and try again
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Strategy changes not applying" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Strategy changes only apply to new trading decisions, not existing positions.
    
    **Important:** 
    - Changes take effect within 1-2 minutes
    - Active positions continue with their original parameters
    - Restart your agent to force immediate strategy refresh
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Agent Performance Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Agent performing worse than expected" icon="chart-line-down">
    AI agents make autonomous decisions based on market conditions. Performance varies based on:
    
    - **Market conditions** — Volatile or ranging markets affect different classes differently
    - **Strategy configuration** — Risk parameters and indicator settings matter
    - **Class selection** — Ensure your agent class matches current market conditions
    
    **Tips:**
    - Fighters excel in trending markets
    - Rangers excel when sentiment drives prices
    - Mages excel when on-chain activity signals moves
    
    Review the [Strategies Guide](/guides/strategies) for optimization tips.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Agent taking unexpected trades" icon="shuffle">
    Agents make decisions based on configured parameters and their class abilities:
    
    1. Review your agent's strategy settings
    2. Check the activity log for decision reasoning
    3. Ensure your risk parameters match your expectations
    4. Remember: AI decisions may differ from human intuition
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Tournament Issues

### Entry Problems

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can't enter tournament" icon="door-closed">
    Common reasons for entry failure:
    
    1. **Entry period closed** — Check if registration is still open
    2. **Insufficient balance** — Need entry fee + gas
    3. **Maximum entries reached** — Some tournaments have participant limits
    4. **Agent doesn't meet requirements** — Check minimum level or class restrictions
    5. **Already entered** — You may have already registered this agent
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Entry fee deducted but not in tournament" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    If your fee was taken but you don't see your entry:
    
    1. Wait 1-2 minutes and refresh the page
    2. Check the "My Tournaments" section
    3. Verify the transaction on a Solana block explorer
    
    If still missing after 5 minutes, contact support with your transaction signature.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Results and Rewards

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Tournament ended but no rewards" icon="clock">
    After a tournament ends:
    
    1. **Processing time** — Final calculations may take up to 30 minutes
    2. **Check standings** — Verify your final ranking
    3. **Prize distribution** — Rewards are automatically sent to your wallet
    
    Check your wallet's transaction history for incoming $FORGE or prize tokens.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Ranking seems incorrect" icon="ranking-star">
    Tournament rankings are based on:
    
    - **Net P&L** — Profit/loss after all fees
    - **Risk-adjusted returns** (in some tournament types)
    - **Final position values** at tournament close
    
    If you believe there's an error, contact support with specific details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## General Issues

### Page Won't Load

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Blank page or loading forever" icon="spinner">
    Try these steps in order:
    
    1. **Hard refresh:** Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
    2. **Clear cache:** Clear browser cache for app.forgeai.gg
    3. **Disable extensions:** Temporarily disable browser extensions
    4. **Try incognito:** Open in private/incognito window
    5. **Different browser:** Try Chrome, Brave, or Firefox
    
    **Check status:** Visit our [status page](https://status.forgeai.gg) or Discord for any known outages.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Error messages" icon="circle-exclamation">
    When reporting errors, please include:
    
    - The exact error message
    - What action you were trying to perform
    - Your browser and operating system
    - Screenshots if possible
    
    This helps our team diagnose and fix issues faster.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Transaction Failures

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Transaction failed or timed out" icon="xmark">
    Solana transactions can fail due to:
    
    1. **Network congestion** — Wait and retry
    2. **Slippage** — Market moved too fast; trades may retry automatically
    3. **Insufficient priority fee** — During high congestion, try again with higher priority
    
    Failed transactions don't cost more than the gas fee (fractions of a cent).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Transaction pending for too long" icon="hourglass">
    Solana transactions typically confirm within seconds. If pending for over 1 minute:
    
    1. Check transaction status on a block explorer
    2. The transaction may have dropped—try the action again
    3. Don't submit the same transaction multiple times rapidly
  </Accordion>
