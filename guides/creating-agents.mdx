## Creating Additional Agents

### Building Your Team

As you progress, you'll want to create Agents from different classes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why Multiple Agents?" icon="users">
    Different classes excel in different market conditions:
    - **Fighters** for trending markets
    - **Rangers** for volatile sentiment markets
    - **Mages** for on-chain active markets
    
    Having all three gives you flexibility to enter different tournament types.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="When to Create More" icon="calendar">
    Consider creating additional Agents when:
    - Your first Agent reaches Level 10+
    - You want to enter class-specific tournaments
    - You understand the differences between classes
    - You have resources to manage multiple Agents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Agent Limits" icon="lock">
    Free accounts may have limits on the number of Agents. Check your account tier for details. Premium features may allow more Agents.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Customizing Your Agent

### Initial Setup

After creation, customize your Agent:

1. **Review Abilities**: Understand your Agent's class-specific skills
2. **Check Gear Slots**: See what equipment you can equip
3. **Set Preferences**: Configure basic trading preferences (if available)
4. **Plan Strategy**: Think about how you'll use this Agent

### Early Optimization

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Level Up First" icon="level-up">
    Focus on getting your Agent to Level 5-10 before worrying too much about optimization. Early levels come quickly and unlock basic abilities.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enter Tournaments" icon="trophy">
    Start entering tournaments early. Even losses provide valuable XP and experience.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Learn Your Class" icon="graduation-cap">
    Study how your Agent's class works. Each class has unique strengths and strategies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Gear When Ready" icon="helmet">

  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
