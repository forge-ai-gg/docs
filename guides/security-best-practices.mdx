## Overview

Security is critical when dealing with cryptocurrency and autonomous trading agents. This guide covers best practices to keep your assets safe while using ForgeAI.

<Warning>
Never share your private keys, seed phrases, or passwords with anyone—including ForgeAI support. We will never ask for these.
</Warning>

## Wallet Security

### Choosing the Right Wallet

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Hardware Wallets" icon="microchip">
    **Most Secure** — Ledger, Trezor
    
    Best for holding significant assets. Keys never leave the device.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Browser Wallets" icon="browser">
    **Convenient** — Phantom, Solflare
    
    Good for active trading. Enable all security features.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Wallet Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use a dedicated trading wallet" icon="wallet">
    **Don't use your main holdings wallet for trading.**
    
    Create a separate wallet specifically for ForgeAI:
    - Transfer only what you need for trading and tournament entries
    - Keep the majority of your assets in cold storage
    - If compromised, your main holdings remain safe
    
    <Tip>Think of it like a checking account vs. savings account.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Enable all security features" icon="shield">
    For browser wallets like Phantom:
    
    - **Auto-lock timer** — Set to 5-15 minutes
    - **Password protection** — Use a strong, unique password
    - **Transaction confirmations** — Review every transaction before signing
    - **Trusted apps only** — Only connect to verified dApps
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Secure your seed phrase" icon="key">
    Your seed phrase (recovery phrase) is the master key to your wallet:
    
    **Do:**
    - Write it on paper and store in a secure location (fireproof safe)
    - Consider metal backup plates for durability
    - Split across multiple secure locations for large holdings
    
    **Never:**
    - Store it digitally (photos, cloud storage, notes apps)
    - Enter it on any website
    - Share it with anyone, ever
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Verify transaction details" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Before signing any transaction:
    
    1. Check the **destination address** matches what you expect
    2. Verify the **amount** is correct
    3. Review **token type** — watch for fake tokens
    4. Check **gas fees** are reasonable
    
    <Warning>Malicious sites can disguise transactions. Always verify in your wallet, not on the website.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Account Security

### Protecting Your ForgeAI Account

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Use secure authentication" icon="fingerprint">
    ForgeAI uses Privy for authentication with multiple options:
    
    **Recommended:** Social login (Google, Twitter) with 2FA enabled on those accounts
    
    For email login:
    - Use a dedicated email address
    - Enable 2FA on your email provider
    - Use a strong, unique password
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor connected sessions" icon="desktop">
    Periodically review active sessions:
    
    - Log out of devices you don't recognize
    - Disconnect unused wallet connections
    - Review authorized applications
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be cautious with API access" icon="code">
    If using the ForgeAI API:
    
    - Never share your Privy JWT tokens
    - Don't commit tokens to version control
    - Rotate tokens if you suspect compromise
    - Use environment variables, not hardcoded values
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Agent Security

### Managing Agent Wallets

Your agents trade with dedicated wallets secured in Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs):

<Accordion title="How agent key security works" icon="lock">
  **Your agents' private keys are:**
  - Generated and stored within secure TEE enclaves
  - Never exposed to ForgeAI servers or developers
  - Encrypted at rest and in transit
  - Only accessible by the TEE for signing transactions
  
  **You maintain control through:**
  - Starting/stopping agent trading
  - Configuring strategy parameters
  - Withdrawing funds at any time
</Accordion>

### Tournament Safety

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Understand tournament risks" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    In tournaments:
    - Entry fees are your maximum risk
    - Agents trade with allocated tournament capital
    - Your personal wallet isn't at risk beyond the entry fee
    - Prizes are distributed automatically via smart contracts
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Start small" icon="seedling">
    When learning the platform:
    
    1. Begin with lower-stakes tournaments
    2. Understand how your agents perform
    3. Learn from losses without significant impact
    4. Scale up as you gain experience
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Recognizing Threats

### Common Scams to Avoid

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Phishing sites" icon="fish">
    **Red flags:**
    - URLs that look similar but aren't exact (forge-ai.gg, forgeaii.gg)
    - Unsolicited DMs with "special offers"
    - Requests to "verify" or "sync" your wallet
    
    **Always:**
    - Type `app.forgeai.gg` directly or use bookmarks
    - Verify the URL before connecting your wallet
    - Check for the lock icon (HTTPS)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fake support" icon="user-secret">
    **ForgeAI team will NEVER:**
    - DM you first on Discord or Twitter
    - Ask for your private keys or seed phrase
    - Request remote access to your computer
    - Send you links to "verify" your wallet
    
    **Official support channels:**
    - support@forgeai.gg
    - Discord #support channel (official server only)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Fake tokens and airdrops" icon="gift">
    Be wary of:
    - Random tokens appearing in your wallet
    - "Free" airdrops that require you to connect your wallet
    - Tokens that require approval to "sell" or "claim"
    
    <Warning>Interacting with malicious tokens can drain your wallet. When in doubt, ignore unknown tokens.</Warning>
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Social engineering" icon="comments">
    Attackers may:
    - Create urgency ("Act now or lose your funds!")
    - Impersonate team members or moderators
    - Offer "help" with suspiciously good deals
    
    Take your time. Verify through official channels. Real opportunities don't disappear in minutes.
