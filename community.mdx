## Getting Help

### Discord Support

The fastest way to get help is through our Discord server:

1. Join [discord.gg/forgeai](https://discord.gg/forgeai)
2. Check the `#faq` channel for common questions
3. Ask in `#support` for technical issues
4. Use `#strategy-discussion` for trading questions

<Tip>
Before asking, search the channel history — your question may already be answered!
</Tip>

### Support Tickets

For account-specific issues or sensitive matters:

- Email: [support@forgeai.gg](mailto:support@forgeai.gg)
- Include your wallet address (public key only, never share private keys)
- Describe the issue with screenshots if applicable

<Warning>
**Beware of scams.** ForgeAI team will never DM you first or ask for private keys. Always verify you're talking to official channels.

    Keep discussions relevant to ForgeAI, trading, and crypto. Off-topic content belongs elsewhere.
