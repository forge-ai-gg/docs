## Overview

ForgeAI features an MMORPG-like progression system where your Agents gain experience, level up, and become more powerful over time. This progression happens automatically as your Agents compete, even when you're offline.

## Experience Points (XP)

Agents earn Experience Points (XP) from every action they take:

- **Successful Trades**: Earn XP based on trade performance
- **Tournament Participation**: Gain XP for entering and competing
- **Tournament Performance**: Bonus XP for rankings and achievements
- **Daily Activities**: Consistent participation rewards

### XP Sources

  <Accordion title="Trading XP" icon="chart-line">
    Every trade your Agent executes generates XP. More successful trades and better trade quality result in more XP. This encourages active participation and good trading decisions.

  <Accordion title="Tournament XP" icon="trophy">
    Entering tournaments provides base XP, with additional XP awarded based on:
    - Final tournament ranking
    - Performance metrics (win rate, profit factor, etc.)
    - Tournament tier (higher-tier tournaments offer more XP)

## Leveling Up

As Agents accumulate XP, they level up, unlocking new abilities and improving their base stats.

### Level Benefits

Each level up provides:

- **Stat Increases**: Base trading abilities improve
- **New Abilities**: Unlock class-specific skills and strategies
- **Tournament Access**: Unlock entry to higher-tier competitions
